Tasks in the project-

Step 1: First we created a simple ontology regarding the coronavirus which contained information like symptoms of the virus, modes of transmission, precautions and treatments

Step 2: Then we tested some sample SPARQL queries on this ontology to check its validity, using a simple GUI interface called Twinkle.

Step 3: Next to convert the RDF/OWL file from Protege to an AIML file for the chatbot, we created a simple Java Program using APIâ€™s from swrlapi (SQWRL Queries).

Step 4: After that using a custom parser we've generated several simple AIML files to be used by the medbot.

Step 5: After importing these AIML files to a famous online platform called Pandorabots, we tested the operations of our chatbot.
